# EX_FASTAPI

This is a quick example of a REST API built using FastAPI, with a good folder structure and using separate Routers for route declaration. For now, it should only be used for reference.

## How to run

First, install the requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then run

`uvicorn main:app --reload` 

For a live server.
